# Affordable-Home-Analysis

This project is part of my internship assignment where my team and I were tasked to conduct market research on affordable housing in the Klang Valley region. Shoutout to Far Loon, my intenrship supervisor for giving me the opportunity to be a part of this project. It is a wholesome project and I have so many things to learn from it.

Objective  
To analyze supply dynamics and price distributions among key housing programmes and deliver insights to stakeholders.

Research Methodology

1. Desktop Research: I gathered data from authoritative sources, including National Property Information Centre (NAPIC), Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM), and various government programme portals (e.g., Residensi Wilayah, Rumah Selangorku, Residensi Prihatin).
2. Data Visualization: The insights were presented using various charts via Flourish to show clear visual narratives around population trends, housing supply, and programme performance.

--> Review Process: All findings and visuals were reviewed and cross-checked by my superior. Upon approval, the final report was submitted to the stakeholder and published on the company’s website. 

Key Findings

1. Population Growth & Housing Demand
   1. From 2017 to 2021, Malaysia’s population rose from around 32.0 million to 32.6 million (0.5% annually) — with Klang Valley accounting for approximately 8.3 to 8.4 million residents (~25% of the nation). This sustained growth underscores ongoing pressure on affordable housing supply.
2. Current & Future Affordable Housing Supply
   1. As of 2021, approximately 2.1 million housing units existed in the Klang Valley, but only 530,101 of these were classified as affordable
   2. An additional 4,002 units are incoming, with 7,343 units planned in the near term
3. Spotlight on Three Key Programmes: KVAH Tri-Programme
   1. We focused on the Tri-Programme consisting of:
      1. Residensi Wilayah (RW)
      2. Residensi Prihatin (RP)
      3. Rumah Selangorku (RSKU)
    2. Collectively, these encompass 72 housing projects with a total of 53,244 units as of 2021
    3. Residensi Wilayah leads in project count (43) and supply (29,952 units).
    4. Residensi Prihatin follows (15,061 units), projected to overtake RSKU by 2024.
    5. RSKU currently stands at 8,231 units
  4. Projected Supply Trends
     1. Supply ramps up significantly from 2021 onwards, peaking in 2024 with an estimated 16,868 units.
     2. Post-2024, projections dip sharply — to 2,166 units in 2025, and 678 units in 2026
     3. Notably, the Rumah Idaman programme (42,992 units) could dramatically alter supply dynamics if included
  5. Unit Size, Pricing & Location Insights
     1. Unit Size: The most prevalent size is 701–800 sqft, accounting for 53.7% of units. Next is 801–900 sqft at 28.8%. Putrajaya leads in the 701–800 sqft category (~12,349 units). Seputeh dominates the 801–900 sqft category (~6,076 units). Setapak holds the most units in the 901–1,000 sqft range (~1,098 units) 
     2. Price Range: The most common price band is RM 240,001 – RM 300,000 (~41.4%).Next most common is RM 100,001 – RM 200,000 (~35.7%). Within per-square-foot pricing, RM 251–300/sqft is dominant (~35.7%), followed by RM 351–400/sqft (~28.6%) 

Summary Insights

1. Demand continues to grow, yet affordable housing supply remains insufficient and unevenly distributed.
2. Residensi Wilayah is currently the biggest player, but Residensi Prihatin is expected to catch up by 2024.
3. Sharp supply fluctuations post-2024 may present challenges for planning and policy.
4. Most housing units are small to mid-size in both area and price — aligning with affordability goals.
